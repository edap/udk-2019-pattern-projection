This course focuses on patterns composition and projection on surfaces using shaders and openFrameworks.

*Requirements:*

- A working installation of openFrameworks >= to 0.10.1.
- These [ofxAutoReloadedShader](https://github.com/andreasmuller/ofxAutoReloadedShader) and [ofxGLWarper](https://github.com/roymacdonald/ofxGLWarper) in your `addons` folder.

### Class Activities

- Your first shader

### Homework
- Find an artist working with pattern, collect 3/4 images of its work, you will show them in class the next lesson with your pattern.


<a name="#functions-and-colors">

## Functions and colors

</a>

- chapter [5](https://thebookofshaders.com/05/) and [6](https://thebookofshaders.com/06/)of "The Book of Shader".



### Resources/Inspiration

- Inigo Quiles [functions](http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/functions/functions.htm)

### Class Activities

- Frontal lesson

### Homework

- Make at least 4 sketches. You have to use these functions (they do not have to appear all in the same sketch): `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `fract`, `step`, `smoothstep`, `mod`, `mix`, `pow` 
- Finish to read [chapter 6](https://thebookofshaders.com/06/)

### Resources/Inspiration

- Chapter [7](https://thebookofshaders.com/07/) and [8](https://thebookofshaders.com/08/)of the Book of Shaders.
- Hugh Kennedy [interactive tutorial](http://hughsk.io/fragment-foundry/chapters/07-distance-fields.html)
- Inigo's 2d distance function [reference page](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions2d/distfunctions2d.htm)

### Class Activities


### Homework
- Draw a form that combines several shapes.


<a name="#matrices-and-patterns">

## Matrices and Patterns

</a>


### Resources/Inspiration

- chapter [8](https://thebookofshaders.com/08/) and [9](https://thebookofshaders.com/09/) of the Book of Shaders.
- Multi-scale truchet patterns [1](http://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2018/bridges2018-39.pdf) and [2](https://christophercarlson.com/portfolio/multi-scale-truchet-patterns/).

### Class Activities

- Create your own pattern.


### Homework
- Create at least 2 patterns, one of those has to be a truchet pattern.
- Think about a fabric on which you would like to project your pattern, think about how to hang it to a wall, if you want to project on a wall. Think about how could you move it, if you want to move it.


<a name="#audioreactive">

## Audioreactive

</a>


### Class activities

- Finish truchet patterns
- Boolean operations see file BooleanOperation.frag
- 2D noise
- Make a copy of the OF app "template shader audio reactive".

### Resources/Inspiration


### Homework

- Make at least 5 audio reactive patterns.


### Extra

Have a look at:
- Rioji Ikeda [works](http://www.ryojiikeda.com/)
- Chapter [10](https://thebookofshaders.com/10/) and [11](https://thebookofshaders.com/11/) of the Book of shader.

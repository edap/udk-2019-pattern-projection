### Class Activities

- Create your own pattern.


### Homework
- Create at least 2 patterns, one of those has to be a truchet pattern.
- Think about a fabric on which you would like to project your pattern, think about how to hang it to a wall, if you want to project on a wall. Think about how could you move it, if you want to move it.

This course focuses on patterns composition and projection on surfaces using shaders and openFrameworks.

*Requirements:*

- A working installation of openFrameworks >= to 0.10.1.
- These [ofxAutoReloadedShader](https://github.com/andreasmuller/ofxAutoReloadedShader) and [ofxGLWarper](https://github.com/roymacdonald/ofxGLWarper) in your `addons` folder.

### Class Activities

- Your first shader

### Homework
- Find an artist working with pattern, collect 3/4 images of its work, you will show them in class the next lesson with your pattern.

- Create your own pattern.


### Homework
- Create at least 2 patterns, one of those has to be a truchet pattern.
- Think about a fabric on which you would like to project your pattern, think about how to hang it to a wall, if you want to project on a wall. Think about how could you move it, if you want to move it.
